1) Week 5 Lecture

1a) Preparation

I'm interested in learning if DNS amplification attacks against the root DNS
servers were successful is disrupting Internet connectivity. Since these `13
root server` are actually load-balanced end-points, I would expect that the
attack was unsuccessful. A more effective attach vector would be to infultrate
the root server infrastructure and attack from the inside.
