1) Week 7 Lecture

1a) Preparation

I'm interested in learning if DNS amplification attacks against the root DNS
servers were successful is disrupting Internet connectivity. Since these `13
root server` are actually load-balanced end-points, I would expect that the
attack was unsuccessful. A more effective attach vector would be to infultrate
the root server infrastructure and attack from the inside.

3) After Class

It was interesting and gratifying to hear that Anonymous hackers were unable to
attack the root DNS servers and that the threat was fake.
