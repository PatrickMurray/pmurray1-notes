1) Week 5 Lecture

1a) Preparation

After reviewing the course slides, I'm excited to review the TCP/IP stack.
After attempting to configure networking a few weeks ago on a laptop with
Debian minimal installed, I ran into numerous issues regarding wireless
communications and networks failing to resume after system suspension. I'm
interested to see if any of the problems I've encountered are shared by others.
