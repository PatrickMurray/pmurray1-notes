1) Week 5 Lecture

1a) Preparation

After reviewing the course slides, I'm excited to review the TCP/IP stack.
After attempting to configure networking a few weeks ago on a laptop with
Debian minimal installed, I ran into numerous issues regarding wireless
communications and networks failing to resume after system suspension. I'm
interested to see if any of the problems I've encountered are shared by others.

3) After Class

Well, I guess the Internet really is a series of tubes - Al Gore was correct
all along! On a more serious note, I found the maps of undersea cables to be
very interesting. I've heard of submarine activity occurring near
intercontinental cables - mainly Russia off the East Coast. In addition to
their substantial value, I'm curios if any spectrum analyses could sniff 
plain-text traffic across these fiber optic cables. This idea would seem more
plausible with copper cables; however, I'm not sure how lasers would be
detected as effectively.
