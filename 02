1) Week 2 Lecture

1a) Preparation

In preparation for the second lecture, I reviewed the lecture slides and
researched Amazon's Elastic File System product offering. [0]

From an operating system point of view, I understand how the file system is
organized as a data structure within the Linux kernel; however, I find it
difficult to comprehend how an external internet accessible resource can be
mounted locally to a system. I hypothesize that for EFS the hypervisor mimics
a storage medium; however, my case still stands for other storage devices like
a NAS or SAN.
