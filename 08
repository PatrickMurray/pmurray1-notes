1) Week 8 Lecture

1a) Preparation

I'm interested in learning the problems that can arise with the deployment of
HTTPS and it's potential affects on client adoption.

3) After Class

The class lecture regarding SMTP was incredibly insightful. The task of
deploying a personal mail server seems interesting, one day I hope to deploy my
own as a part of my personal infrastructure. I was unaware of the separation of
mail server, mail client, delivery system, and spam analyzer.
