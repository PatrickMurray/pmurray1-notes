1) Week 3 Lecture

1a) Preparation

In preparation for this class, I reviewed the slides and recollected my
knowledge of the initialization process for modern systems. Although I have
experience with configuration management software, such as Ansible, my
knowledge of the Linux init system is limited beyond basic systemd utilities.
During this lecture, I hope to learn more about the hardware channels used by
the operating system to interact with hardware.

3) After Class

Although I was aware of the mess of the NodeJS package manager, I found the
discussion to be insightful regarding the detection & updating of software
installed via miscellaneous sources external of the system's default package
manager.
