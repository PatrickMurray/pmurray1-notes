1) Week 4 Lecture

1a) Preparation

In preparation for this class, I reviewed the lecture slides and read the
textbook reading regarding Unix users and groups. Prior to this lecture, I'm
interested in learning about how to NOT organize Unix groups - as my experience
with them has only been negative. In addition, I'm interested in other
technologies such as LDAP.
