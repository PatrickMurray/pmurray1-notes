1) Week 4 Lecture

1a) Preparation

In preparation for this class, I reviewed the lecture slides and read the
textbook reading regarding Unix users and groups. Prior to this lecture, I'm
interested in learning about how to NOT organize Unix groups - as my experience
with them has only been negative. In addition, I'm interested in other
technologies such as LDAP.

3) After Class

Working through the in class exercise, I was once again reminded of my
confusion over the differences between the adduser(8) and useradd(8) commands
and arguments. I'm sure that there are some historical differences as to why
these two tools exist to perform the same job. I hypothesize that their
existence is the result of a long standing UNIX dispute similar to which
built-ins are "required" in a distribution.
